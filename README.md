# Motorman
This Processing sketch was inspired by David Ohle's book, Motorman, 
a sci fi story where it's inhabitants live in a polluted, paranoid, dystopic future where they are under constant surveillance by 
an ominous entity.

This is a call and response sketch, where the viewer is invited to respond to the questions that appear. 
When they type their response and press enter, they are then taken to a surveillance terminal, 
where they watch a reconfiguration of a surveillance video and listen to a soundscape. 
I wanted to create a disorienting atmosphere where things are a bit of a mystery and not quite what they seem. 
I was interested in creating a conceptual sketch inspired by the passages in the book and also it's bleak landscape. 

After learning how to create text data, video and sound in processing, I was excited to put these elements together to form the sketch.

This was a final project for an ITP NYU course: Introduction to Computational Media (ICM), Fall 2013
